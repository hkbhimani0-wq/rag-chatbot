Parallel and Distributed Computing
Introduction

Parallel and Distributed Computing are advanced computing techniques used to improve system performance, speed, and efficiency by executing multiple tasks simultaneously. These approaches are widely used in modern systems such as cloud computing, big data processing, artificial intelligence, and scientific simulations.

Parallel Computing
Definition

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which multiple processors or cores work together simultaneously to solve a single problem by dividing it into smaller sub-tasks.

Key Characteristics

Tasks are executed at the same time

Uses multiple CPUs or cores

Processors usually share common memory
